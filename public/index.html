    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! <b>I'm John Andrew G. Mendoza (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science)</b>, a passionate web designer and web developer with a strong eye for aesthetics and a mind for code. I specialize in crafting visually engaging, fully responsive, and highly functional websites that blend design excellence with robust development. From concept to launch, I bring digital ideas to life through a seamless integration of creative UI/UX design and modern front-end and back-end technologies.

      With hands-on experience in <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Php, React, Node.js</b>, and design tools like <b>Figma and Adobe XD</b>, I have delivered websites and applications that are not only beautiful but also intuitive and performance-optimized. I thrive on solving problems, improving user experiences, and creating clean, maintainable code that meets both user needs and business goals.

      My approach to every project is grounded in collaboration, adaptability, and a commitment to quality. I enjoy working with diverse teams, listening closely to client needs, and finding innovative ways to bring their ideas to life. Whether it's designing a sleek user interface or building a scalable web solution, I aim to deliver work that not only looks great but also performs exceptionally.

      I'm always eager to take on new challenges, contribute to meaningful projects, and grow as both a designer and developer. I believe that technology has the power to inspire and connect people—and I’m excited to be part of that process. If you're looking for someone who's passionate, reliable, and always striving to improve, let’s connect and create something incredible together.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>This project highlights my experience, web development, UX design, data analysis through the development of a responsive website (or interactive data dashboard, etc.) designed to briefly explain project purpose, improve user engagement, streamline data visualization, automate reporting. I took charge of designing and implementing key features, including a clean and intuitive user interface, a secure and efficient backend, and dynamic interactive elements such as charts and real-time data updates.

      Utilizing technologies like <b>JavaScript, Python, SQL</b>, and frameworks/tools such as <b>React, Node.js</b>, I ensured the solution is scalable, maintainable, and optimized for performance across devices. The primary goal was to solve (specific problem), enhance user experience, and deliver actionable insights through seamless integration of front-end and back-end components.

      This project demonstrates my ability to combine technical skills with thoughtful design to create impactful digital products that meet both user needs and business objectives.</p>
